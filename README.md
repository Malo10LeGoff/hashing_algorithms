Implementations of hash functions

The first one to be implemented is MD5, quite classic but still used. MD5 is pretty bad when it comes to encrypting a password for instance. Mainly because it's very fast so a hacker can test a lot of different combinations in a short amount of time. Since it's very fast, it is used for computing digest of large files/data so they are easier to recognize.

How to test the code ? 
    1. Clone the repository locally on your computer
    2. run pip3 install bitarray
    3. python3 md5.py
 To test it, you have to download the code, install the library bitarray with pip install bitarray, and run the code with any string you want to encode
