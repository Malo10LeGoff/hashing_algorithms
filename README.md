Implementations of hash functions
The first one to be implemented is MD5, quite classic but still used.
MD5 is quite bad when it comes to encrypting a password for instance.
Mainly because it's very fast so a hacker can test a lot of different
combinations in a short amount of time. Since it's very fast, it is used
for computing digest of large files/data so they are easier to recognize.
To test it, you have to download the code, install the library bitarray
with pip install bitarray, and run the code with any string you want to
encode
